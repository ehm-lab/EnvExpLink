# Reconstructing individual-level exposures in cohort analyses of environmental risks: an example with the UK Biobank

## Sample code for environment and residential data linkage

### R code
The three R scripts demonstrate the linkage steps. Specifically:

01_resid_health_data.R Creates the simulated study participant and location data  
02_exposure_series.R Carries out the linkage of environmental data and participant locations  
03_plots.R Plots the participant location and linked exposure series
